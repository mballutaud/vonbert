Introduction
============

This package was created as part of the training course "Good practices for reproducible research in digital ecology" co-organized by the Cesab of the FRB and the GDR EcoStat.
It uses the model de @Bertalanffy1938.



Material and methods
============

#### Datasource

The data used comes from the website https://www.fishbase.in/home.htm.

#### Statistical methods

The Growth model of Von Bertalanffy is $$Linf.(1-exp^{-K*(a-to)})$$
with Linf = ???, K = ??? and t0 = ???.

Model was adjusted using the method described by  @rafail_simple_1973.



Results
=======


```{r , eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Figure 1. Number of ecoregions per species"}
plot_fish(fig1)

Discussion
==========

Working with others on a project is much more complicated than working alone, but much faster.
